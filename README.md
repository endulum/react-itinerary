# React Itinerary

Exploration of React's features through a To-Do application.

## Goals
* [x] Pass stateful itinerary data as props to components
* [x] Pass callbacks to components to change itinerary data
* [ ] Store itinerary data locally whenever it changes
* [ ] Use a reducer to manage stateful itinerary data
* [ ] Use Context to deeply deliver itinerary data
* [x] Use Router to navigate between itinerary lists as pages
* [x] Use testing to fortify confidence in app functionality
 
## To Do
- review for possible duplicate code among Overview and Lists
- move functions to Context
- add functions for adding and deleting tasks/lists
- explore styling
